# Static Website Builder

This repository contains code for building a static website using a static file generator.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a simple, static website that can be hosted on any web server without the need for server-side processing. This approach is beneficial for lightweight websites that don't require dynamic content generation.

## Tools Used

- [Static File Generator](https://example.com): This project utilizes a static file generator to convert templates and content files into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served directly by a web server.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install any dependencies required by the static file generator.
3. Run the static file generator with the appropriate configuration to generate the website files.
4. Once the files are generated, they can be hosted on any web server.
